# Challenge ROADEF 2022

The 2022 ROADEF challenge presents an affectation problem for the logistic chain of Renault. As a young graduate of a computer science master degree with a specialization in operational research as of 2023, I present in this project my work to analyse, model, and solve the problem formulated by Renault. However, I am not a competing participant, I only work on this project for training as well as exploratory purposes.

## Content

### Conception & Documentation

_Comparative Analysis of Solving Methods_ aims to work on and compile analyses of some resolution methods for the logistic problem.

_Placement Algorithms_ presents different algorithms to solve the placement of stacks into a singular truck, with time and space analysis, aswell as optimality bounds analysis.

_Modelisation_ presents a modelisation of the problem as a mixed-integer problem.

### Application

The ultimate goal of this project is to implement a julia application allowing to solve efficiently the truck loading optimization problem as described by Renault.

The application is not operational yet, as analyses of resolution methods are still an ongoing work.
